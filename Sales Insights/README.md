# Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

This Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into sales performance of a hardware company dcalled Atliq Hardwares. By analysing various aspects of the sales data, using a power bi dashboard, what we will get as an end 
product is this powerful dashboard where we can track revenue trends, sales quantity numbers year over year, track the revenue breakdown by regions and so on.


## Data Source

The primary data source for this project is SQL database dump "db_dump_version_2.sql" containing detailed information about the sales made by the company.
## ðŸ›  Tools
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating Reports


## Data Cleaning/Preparation (ETL)

In the ETL phase I performed the following tasks:

 1. Loaded data and analysed the data using SQL.
 2. Using PowerBi, created a star scheme data model by establishing relationship between the tables.
 3. Cleaned and transformed data by removing null and irrelevant values. I removed-1 values sales quantity column, 0 vales in sales amount column. 
Also removed rows having market name "New York" and "Paris" as we are concerned about the business happened only in India.
4. In the transactions table currency column was having duplicate currency values.

```
select distinct(transactions.currency) from transactions;
```

INR and USD were in two different formats.
"INR", "INR\r","USD","USD\r".

```
select count(*) from transactions where transactions.currency='USD';
```

Based on the situation we removed rows with the values 'INR' and 'USD' as this format has the lowest count.
